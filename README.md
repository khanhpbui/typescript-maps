# typescript-maps

The primary objective behind the creation of this repository is to document my learning journey and capture my notes on TypeScript. I will utilize this platform to construct a basic map application, with the intention of familiarizing myself with design patterns in TypeScript.


## Installation

In order to run TypeScript in the browser, I am utilizing the Parcel Bundler:
```
npx parcel index.html
```


npm install @faker-js/faker
